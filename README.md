# ChatTweaks
This mod makes the following improvements to the in-game chat:
- Splits the Team Chat out so it appears on the right hand side separately from the general server chat and server notifications. 
- Increased the length of chat history visible on screen. 
- Also fixed the oldest messages getting cut off by the top of the screen.
- Chat messages stays on screen for 10 seconds (rather than 5 seconds).

Compatable with Revolution version 1.4 and most other mods. 
This mod only edits the interations.LUA file
